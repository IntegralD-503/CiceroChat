    <p>Hi, My name is Hunter Clark.  I have been having some fun fooling around with some llm's and figured why not make a web page for a chatbot as a personal project.</p>

    <h3>brief bio</h3>
    <p>I love building software and tinkering with technology. Whether it is Raspberry Pi's running media servers and bitcoin nodes, or virtual machines for Infosec practice, I am usually messing around with something.  I am a big Linux fan. Also, I like cracking machines on Hack the Box, and lately I have been deep diving into Machine Learning to try to keep up with all the fun and exciting progress happening in that field.  I have been on a sabbatical for the past year in which I have done some traveling in South America and plenty of scuba diving in South Florida.  Lately, I just hack on stuff and hang out with my two dogs Lucy and Zoey.</p>
